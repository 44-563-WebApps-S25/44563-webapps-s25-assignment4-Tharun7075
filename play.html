    <h2>Twelfth Night</h2>
    <h3>SCENE II. The sea-coast.</h3>
     <p class="stage-direction">Enter VIOLA, a Captain, and Sailors</p>
    <h4 class="viola">VIOLA</h4>
       <p class="speech">What country, friends, is this?</p> 
        <h4 class="Captain">Captain</h4>
        <p class="speech">This is Illyria, lady.</p>
        <h4 class="viola">VIOLA</h4>
        <p class="speech">And what should I do in Illyria?
        My brother he is in Elysium.
        Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you, sailors? </p>
        <h4 class="Captain">Captain</h4>
        <p class="speech">It is perchance that you yourself were saved.</p>
        <h4 class="viola">VIOLA</h4>
       <p class="speech">O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.</p> 
        <h4 class="Captain">Captain</h4>
       <p class="speech"> True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,
        Assure yourself, after our ship did split,
        When you and those poor number saved with you
        Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,
        Most provident in peril, bind himself,
        Courage and hope both teaching him the practise,
        To a strong mast that lived upon the sea;
        Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,
        I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
        So long as I could see.</p>
        <h4 class="viola">VIOLA</h4>
        <p class="speech">For saying so, there's gold:
        Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,
        Whereto thy speech serves for authority,
        The like of him. Know'st thou this country?</p>
        <h4 class="Captain">Captain</h4>
        <p class="speech">Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born
        Not three hours' travel from this very place.</p>
       <h4 class="viola"> VIOLA</h4>
        <p class="speech">Who governs here?</p>
        <h4 class="Captain">Captain</h4>
       <p class="speech"> A noble duke, in nature as in name.</p>
       <h4 class="viola"> VIOLA</h4> 
        <p class="speech">What is the name?</p>
        <h4 class="Captain">Captain</h4>
       <p class="speech">Orsino.</p>
        <h4 class="viola">VIOLA</h4>
        <p class="speech">Orsino! I have heard my father name him:
        He was a bachelor then.</p>
        <h4 class="Captain">Captain</h4>
        <p class="speech">And so is now, or was so very late;
        For but a month ago I went from hence,
        And then 'twas fresh in murmur,--as, you know,
        What great ones do the less will prattle of,--
        That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.</p>
        <h4 class="viola">VIOLA</h4>
       <p class="speech"> What's she?</p>
        <h4 class="Captain">Captain</h4>
        <p class="speech">A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count
        That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her
        In the protection of his son, her brother,
        Who shortly also died: for whose dear love,
        They say, she hath abjured the company
        And sight of men.</p>
        <h4 class="viola">VIOLA</h4>
        <p class="speech">O that I served that lady
        And might not be delivered to the world,
        Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,
        What my estate is!</p>
        <h4 class="Captain">Captain</h4>
        <p class="speech">That were hard to compass;
        Because she will admit no kind of suit,
        No, not the duke's.</p>
        <h4 class="viola">VIOLA</h4>
        <p class="speech">There is a fair behavior in thee, captain;
        And though that nature with a beauteous wall
        Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee
        I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
        With this thy fair and outward character.
        I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,
        Conceal me what I am, and be my aid
        For such disguise as haply shall become
        The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:
        Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him:
        It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing
        And speak to him in many sorts of music
        That will allow me very worth his service.
        What else may hap to time I will commit;
        Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.</p>
       <h4 class="Captain"> Captain</h4> 
        <p class="speech">Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be:
        When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.</p>
        <h4 class="viola">VIOLA</h4>
        <p class="speech">I thank thee: lead me on.</p>
        <p class="stage-direction">Exeunt</p>
